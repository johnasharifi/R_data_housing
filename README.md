Data taken from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ -> Home Values -> Median Home Value Per SQFT. While the raw data is contained within the file "Zip_MedianValuePerSqft_AllHomes.csv", it is not recommended that you directly open this file because it is 14 MB.

# Description of dataset
Analysis constrained to only cover home values in California.

Preliminary: Graph of housing value growth per city and metro area in period from 2010.Jan to 2018.November in California. Cities are grouped by metro area, and one horizontal line displays the growth rates of all cities within that metro area.

# Description of result
We compute the mean growth in home-sqft-value of a metro area (with metro area defined by Zillow's research department). We array city growth rates across a horizontal metro area.
